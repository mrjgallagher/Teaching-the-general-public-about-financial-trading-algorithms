# Teaching the general public about financial trading algorithms.

The aim of this project was to create an interactive tool to teach users about two financial trading algorithms. The Project set out to :

- Teach users about the challenges that these algorithms are designed to tackle.
- Teach users about some technically terminology related to the field.
- Provide a working example of two trading algorithms for the users to operate.
- Teach users about the java code implementation of these two algorithms .

The project also let users create and upload their own algorithms (as a .jar file) to run and compare against those provided by system.

This Web application was built using the Play framework, PostgresDb and practical use of a few javascript libraries. Check out the Powerpoint slides for a quick overview !
