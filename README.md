# Teaching the general public about financial trading algorithms.

The aim of this project was to create in interactive tool to teach users about two financial trading algorithms. The Project set out to :

- Teach users the challenges that these algorithms are designed to tackle.
- Teach users some technically terminology related to the field.
- Provide a working example of the two trading algorithms for the users to operate.
- Teach users about the code implementation of these algorithms .

The project also let users create and upload their own algorithms (as a .jar file) to run and compare against those provided by system.

This Web application was built using the Java Play framework/ PostgresDb and practical use of a few javascript libraries. Check out the Powerpoint slides for a quick overview !
